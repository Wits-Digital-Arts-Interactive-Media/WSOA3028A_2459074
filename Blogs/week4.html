    <h2>Blog Post Week 4</h2>
    <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
    <p>My goal:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>I want my website to be able to give those who use it an idea of who I am and what I can produce in terms of
            work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My user:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>As for now my users will most likely be people involved in the industry I want to be a part of someday,
            whether they are marking the work itself for school or even future employers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My content:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>My work</li>
        <li>My experience</li>
        <li>My contact information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Website Progress</h2>
    <p>Developing the website was a cool and exciting experience, it was also somewhat fairly simple in comparison to
        other parts of out degree. I wouldn’t fully say I am 100% confident when it comes to making a website but I can
        say I have learnt quite a lot. I am however excited for css and the coolness of it as it makes the website a
        little more better looking. Javescript not so much as I hear it is difficult to code but as all new things go
        they must be learnt.</p>
