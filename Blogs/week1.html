    <h1>Blog Post Week 1</h1>

    <h2>My experience setting up Github and publishing to Pages</h2>
    <p>I found setting up my Github quite easy as it was something that I had done before in other parts of the degree,
        especially through the game design department. It was quite easy to navigate around as I was already familiar
        with the interface of Github and with the help of our tutor Brendeezy (Brendan) the whole experience was a lot
        smoother. The publishing to Pages was a little bit trickier as for some reason my page would not update as
        quickly so I thought I had done something wrong but it was just taking a little bit more time than usual,
        however apart from that it was relatively easy to do.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on the readings </h2>
    <p>Vannevar Bush's pioneering essay "As We May Think" from 1945 envisaged a future where technology seamlessly
        enhances human cognition. His concept of the Memex, a precursor to today's internet, foresaw a tool that could
        store and retrieve vast knowledge, fostering associative trails of thought. This vision resonates deeply with
        the modern internet, where we traverse interconnected webpages, creating our own paths of exploration. The
        collaborative ethos of online platforms reflects Bush's notion of collective intelligence, yet we confront
        contemporary challenges like information overload and misinformation, underscoring the need for critical
        engagement with digital content. In navigating this digital frontier, we both realize Bush's vision and confront
        new complexities, shaping our understanding of knowledge and information in the digital age.</p>

    <h2>Interesting facts about the history of the web</h2>
    <p>A lot of people confuse the world wide web and the internet as if they are the same thing, but they are not. The
        internet is a huge network of computers all over the world, which are connected. The world wide web - or web -
        is a collection of web pages found on this network of computers.</p>

    <h2>My goals for this course </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>My goals for this course is to become proficient in a new language</li>
        <li>To be able to develop websites</li>
        <li>To also just pass the course</li>
    </ul>
