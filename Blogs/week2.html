    <h2>Blog Post Week 2</h2>

    <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
    <p>As we started with our websites, we were told that we would go through varying iterations of our websites, these
        would also affect our folder structures but for now this is how mine looks like now:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>Portfolio</li>
        <ul>
            <li>portfolio.html</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <ul>
            <li>blog.html</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Essays</li>
        <ul>
            <li>essays.html</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Images</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Will contain all the images in the websites</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Style</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains all the css files for the website</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Scripts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains all the JavaScript files for the website</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>URL Scheme</h2>
    <p>To be quite honest at first, I did not understand what this was for but after some research I think I have a
        rough idea of what it is about. So from what I know I think I am going to use the HTTP Protocol for security
        reasons.</p>

    <h2>Website Wireframes UI</h2>
    <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe Homepage.jpg" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe Portfolio page.jpg" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <p>I have opted for a very basic design, I also noticed that it looks similar to the canvas website. Also since the
        page is very simple the design will remain the same throughout regardless of which tab was chosen. The layout
        will remain the same.</p>

    <h2>Inspirational websites</h2>

    <h2>Reflection on the reading</h2>
    <p>Moulthrop's exploration of hypertext in "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)"
        offers a nuanced perspective on its impact, resonating deeply with the modern internet. His analysis, rooted in
        McLuhan's framework, highlights hypertext's disruptive potential and its parallels with today's digital
        environment. The internet, as a manifestation of hypertext, exemplifies its non-linear structure, enabling
        decentralized communication and information sharing. Moulthrop's insights prompt reflection on contemporary
        phenomena like social media and online communities, showcasing how hypertext continues to shape discourse and
        knowledge dissemination. However, the essay also prompts consideration of modern challenges such as information
        overload and algorithmic biases, underscoring the ongoing relevance of Moulthrop's ideas in navigating the
        complexities of the digital age.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on the Interaction and the www</h2>
    <p>The video was quite easy to digest and understand, I for a long time had always looked at the design of things.
        This is also where I learned about the word “Ergonomic” from my EGD class in high school. I think this relates
        in the same way with the whole situation of the door. What I think we are meant to take from the video is our
        design and its effectiveness to the user.</p>
    <p>The design should be easy to understand, intuitive in a sense. To me interaction refers to the reciprocal action
        between two things, whether it be two entities or a man and a machine. So to relate it to our process, there
        must be interaction between the user and the website. Whether it is through the changing of a page when a link
        clicked, or even to show the link in another colour to show that the link or page has already been opened.</p>
