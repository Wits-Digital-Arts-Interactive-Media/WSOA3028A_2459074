    <h2>Blog Post Week 3</h2>
    <h2>User Alignment</h2>
    <h3>Personal Alignment</h3>
    <p>For the website we are making I want to be able to show all of the projects that I have made, from games,
        websites, to even game assets from blender. I also want to sort it out in a professionally presentable way. I
        also want to be able to provide my contact information as well as my other pages with my work such as itch.io.
    </p>

    <h3>User Alignment</h3>
    <p>The goal for my website is to for my future employers. Through the website I want the employers to be able to get
        an idea of who I am as well as the work I am able to produce. By developing a clean website this could convince
        them to consider me for potential jobs as not only does the website present my work, but it is itself also my
        work. </p>

    <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
    <p>Semantic markup plays a critical role in ensuring the accessibility and usability of a website, particularly for
        users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers. By structuring the HTML code
        with semantic tags such as `header`, `nav`, `article`, and `section`, developers provide clear context about the
        content and its
        organization, aiding both humans and search engines in understanding the webpage's structure and
        meaning. This not only enhances the user experience but also improves search engine optimization.
        Additionally, semantic markup fosters collaboration among developers by making the code more
        readable and understandable, facilitating easier maintenance and updates over time. Incorporating
        semantic tags like `alt`, `figure`, and proper headings ensures that content is presented in a
        logical and well-organized manner, enhancing readability and comprehension for both users
        and developers alike. Moreover, maintaining consistent URL structures with secure schemes
        like HTTPS further contributes to the overall accessibility and security of the website,
        ensuring a seamless browsing experience for all users.</p>
