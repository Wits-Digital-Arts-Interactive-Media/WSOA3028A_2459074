    <h2>Home Page</h2>
    <img src="../Images/Interface Element Homepage.jpg" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <p>This version was the initial wireframe I developed, it is quite simple, and I liked the side bar as I noticed that it was not as popular among other websites and I wanted my website to be a little bit differnet than the rest.</p>
    <img src="../Images/1.png" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <p>Here is the second iteration for the web page, the toggle bar or rather the navigation bar is now moved to the top like other websites, this is ideal as the information has more space to be displayed.</p>
    <h2>Portfolio Page</h2>
    <img src="../Images/Interface Elements Portfolio.jpg" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <p>The page will display the information in this sort of these two coloumn structure, the page will also use a scroll down feature and display from top to bottom.</p>
    <img src="../Images/2.png" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <p>This page is a lot more sleek, the page is better organized and presents the information better. In this one I will also use scroll down features and allow the rest of my stuff to be seen from top to bottom.</p>
    <h2>Blog Page</h2>
    <img src="../Images/Interface Elements Blogs.jpg" alt="Wireframe" width="500">
    <p>This page has a lot of more text information, so the information does not require as much space. In this one I do not need that much space, so I will make use of a scroll down feature</p>
