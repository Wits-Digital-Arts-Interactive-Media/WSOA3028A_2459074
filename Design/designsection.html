    <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
    <p>My goal:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>I want my website to be able to give those who use it an idea of who I am and what I can produce in terms of
            work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My user:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>As for now my users will most likely be people involved in the industry I want to be a part of someday,
            whether they are marking the work itself for school or even future employers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My content:</p>
    <ul id="Bums">
        <li>My work</li>
        <li>My experience</li>
        <li>My contact information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Structure</h2>

    <h2>User Flow</h2>

    <h2>FInal Visual Aesthetic and Elements</h2>
    <P>When it came down to the final aesthetic of my website, I decided to go with minimalism. Not only do I think it looks cleaner, it also was a lot easier to implement. However this did mean that the elements that I want to show must be able to express the idea well. Meaning that a lot of thought was put into the colour palette aswell as the font choice. This also meant that I would not have to use as many icons as I would normally use.</P>
