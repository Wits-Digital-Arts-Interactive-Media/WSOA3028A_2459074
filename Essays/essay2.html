    <h2>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism</h2>
    <p>In her article "Tech Colonialism Today," Sareeta Amrute discusses that digital technologies have colonial relationships at their core, which are structured in ways that are hierarchical, exploitative, and unequal. She has written it in detail and through examples, thus it is visible in evidence in the global software development industry and decisions taken by the major companies like Google. This article presents a current analysis on how digital coloniality affects developers in South Africa. Through an investigation of the global software development labour market, we used Amrute's insights to clarify the nature of the challenges that developers in South Africa face. Furthermore, we will explore what it means for the microeconomics of the tech industry. In conclusion, we will examine our identity as developers and our role in working for fairness and justice in the tech industry and in furthering a decolonized and just digital future. (Amrute, 2019) </p>

    <h3>Amrute's Article on Digital Colonialism</h3>
    <p>In her piece "Tech Colonialism Today," Sareeta Amrute reveals continued colonial dynamics in the tech world. She emphasizes how tech corporations often exploit women and other marginalized groups and communities in the Global South as sources of data, not as co-producers of knowledge. Amrute illustrates the increased entanglement of corporate and state surveillance through public-private partnerships, where pledges for data protection are merely performative and instead mask more pernicious exploitative practices in emerging markets. Such exploitation also often takes the form of unfree labour—reproducing histories of extraction.</p>
    <p>To challenge the problem of tech colonialism, it is necessary to dismantle the narratives of technology that determine the discourse and that are very stiff. Challenging those discourses and proposing alternative discourses is important as a point of departure to deconstructing the colonial structures in tech. For example, it will involve scrutinizing the kinds of benefits technology has promised while recognizing the unequal power relations that continue to expand through technology.</p>
    <p>Amrute introduces the concept of eros to contest the ethics of capitalism that depend on ceaseless productivity and meritocracy in workplaces. Eros is about connection, pleasure, and valuing each other over disposability. This kind of alternative ethic is truly antithetical to the capitalist regime on which tech colonialism is built and a means to more compassionate and equitable tech practices.</p>
    <p>Tech colonialism operates not only within the realm of traditional colonial powers like the United States and Europe but also as a function of colonial power by emerging powers like India, China, and Israel, shaping the global technology sector. This has given way to complex interplays of state and corporate power, with the Global South fashioning and refashioning colonial relationships through both resistance and innovation.</p>
    <p>Reckoning with the ways that colonial legacies are woven into our environments demands an acknowledgment of the indigenous peoples whose lands we occupy and their histories. These are not just historical contexts within which labour is exploited. By doing so, we appreciate more the reality of colonialism and can work to address its contemporary effects on the tech industry.</p>
    <h3>On the International Labor Context</h3>
    <p>This week, Google announced that it is laying off at least 200 employees from its "Core" teams; some roles are going to be moved to India and Mexico, surely to continue this legacy of Google: digital colonialism within the tech industry (Elias, 2024). This case study illuminates the "Tech Colonialism Today" framework, which Sareeta Amrute uses to expose the many intricate power and labour dynamics in a connected world. </p>
    <p>The restructuring at Google reflects the predatory dynamics that are at work in tech firms regarding marginalized workers, argued Amrute. Even though the "Core" teams were doing pivotal work in developing and protecting Google's core line of products, they were sacked. Laying them off proves to be a disregard of their efforts and well-being. In addition, as labour is being moved to countries like India and Mexico, where it is cheaper, Google further perpetuates this colonial relationship of extracting value from emerging markets and driving down expenses.</p>
    <p>The Google layoffs indeed call into question the dominant narrative of the value of technological progress. Even as the company has been thriving financially, the reorganization shows the human costs of its chase for fatter profit margins over its workers' livelihoods. This calls for an interrogation that will help in understanding the deeper implications of tech colonialism and what it means for workers around the globe.</p>
    <p>The notion of 'eros' that Amrute elaborates underscores the potential of human engagement and the intrinsic value of individuals in a moral scheme that runs counter to the profit imperative of the contemporary tech industry. In effect, however, Google's actions are in contradiction to this ethos, as they enable efficiency measures and measures of cost-cutting at the expense of workers' welfare. Embracing such alternative ideologies is crucial for fostering a more compassionate and equitable tech ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Google's shift to India and Mexico is evidence of the global location of colonial power among tech firms. What is happening today is that emerging economies, particularly India, have become the new epicentres of tech development, which attracts multinationals seeking cheaper labour and markets. This entrenches an existing imbalance of power, with the company in question—Google—having an upper hand in influencing countries in the Global South to serve their own interests.</p>
    <p>In this context, it is critical to recognize the broader historical context of colonialism that situates Google's actions. The company's growth in India, Mexico, and other countries reflects a history of earlier patterns of resource extraction and exploitation by colonial powers. An understanding of this legacy is pivotal for addressing the continuing impact of colonialism and reworking a more just tech landscape.</p>
    <p>Another case study that brings out these issues is restructuring and outsourcing in IBM. In the early 2010s, the company shifted many jobs to low-wage countries like India and Brazil to lower its labour costs with a view to boosting profits and staying ahead in global competition. This reveals the company's colonial mentality, whereby low-economic areas are considered as potential sources of cheap labour to benefit the corporation. (Organization, 2019)</p>
    <p>The case of IBM's offshoring practices very much speaks to the type of exploitative dynamics the tech industry encompasses, which Sareeta Amrute talks about in her book. On one side, the company laid off thousands of employees in higher-wage countries like the United States and some regions of Europe, and on the other, it expanded its workforce in lower-wage regions. This strategy often obscures the human and ethical costs of outsourcing, such as job loss and economic disruptions in higher-wage countries and the all-too-often precarious working conditions for those in outsourced locations.</p>
    <p>Opponents say that its outsourcing practices should be more just and ethical. This would include fair wages, job security, and investment in local communities rather than mere cost-cutting. This human connection and the importance attributed to the workers' work link well with Amrute's concept of 'eros,' which critiques this entirely profit-motivated rationale behind such corporate decisions.</p>
    <p>IBM's outsourcing strategy also underlines the globe's asymmetric distribution of colonial power within the tech industry. By shifting jobs to countries like India and Brazil, the company uses its economic and technological dominance to exploit lower labour costs, perpetuating existing power imbalances. Most often, the profits are repatriated to the company's headquarters in the United States, rather than re-invested within the communities where the labour is performed.</p>
    <p>Considering Google's and IBM's corporate global restructuring and outsourcing practices within the context of "Tech Colonialism Today" only makes clearer the kind of hierarchical, exploitative, and unequal relations that exist in the tech industry. These practices, being witnessed through case studies, call for more ethical and equitable approaches to global labour management, thus contributing to broader efforts to decolonize the digital landscape.</p>
    <h3>Comparison of Amrute's Digital Colonialism and the South African Software Development Industry</h3>
    <p>Amrute argues that tech industries often leverage and exploit the knowledge of marginalized communities and view them as raw databases rather than as partners in equal knowledge creation processes. In South Africa, this can be seen by how international companies view the local tech talent. South African developers are almost consistently employed for lower pay compared to those of their counterparts in developed countries, reflecting a colonial outlook in which the Global South offers nothing but cheap labour. This perpetuates economic inequalities and depletes opportunities for local innovation and leadership.</p>
    <p>Amrute points out the need to counter these dominant tech narratives that frame technological development as an inevitable and universally positive process. In South Africa, narratives are usually framed in such a way that outsourcing, as well as other foreign investments, are always a positive addition to economic growth. However, this usually overshadows the exploitative labour practices and the unequal benefits that come with the relationships. By disputing those narratives, South African developers and industrialists can agitate for fairer practices that place local development as well as fair labour conditions at the forefront.</p>
    <p>Amrute points toward the idea of eros: the valuation placed on human connection, pleasure, and the intrinsic worth of individuals versus the capitalist priorities of productivity and meritocracy. In South Africa, the adoption of such an ideology would revolutionize the tech sector. It involves establishing a work culture where the well-being and development of developers are of value, ensuring just pay, and inclusive policies that recognize the contribution of all workers. By creating an environment that would focus on human values and not profit, the South African tech sector can fight the exploitative tendencies attributed to digital colonialism.</p>
    <p>Amrute traces the power dynamics of the tech field beyond just the traditional colonial powers, identifying some emerging economies that are also exploitative. Such a dynamic can be observed in the role South Africa plays within the global tech ecosystem. While South Africa has a growing tech sector, it is still in competition with other developing countries, so it usually gets offered the outsourcing contracts that mainly emanate from multinational corporations. Often, this kind of competition drives down wages and labour standards. Again, the global power imbalances that Amrute is talking about can be perpetuated. Hence, recognizing and dealing with these power dynamics will be necessary for the development of a more equitable tech industry in South Africa.</p>
    <p>To be able to transcend the legacy of colonialism in the tech world today, it is imperative to understand the historical context within which this all played out. In South Africa, this means taking cognizance of the legacy of apartheid and the continuing realities of racial and economic inequality that shape the tech sector. An understanding of these historical factors could help the South African tech industry work towards more inclusive and just practices that tackle the root causes of this inequality. This would mean investment in education and training for the historically disadvantaged, representation in leadership, and a culture of equity and inclusion.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The exploration of the complex dynamic of digital colonialism within the tech industry has left me with a heightened sense of responsibility. It's not about pulling these issues apart or critiquing the status quo; it's about understanding my place in that complex web and my role in fostering decoloniality.</p>
    <p>I see myself as a changemaker in this rapidly evolving technological landscape, more than merely a developer or player in this industry. I am a steward, responsible for challenging the established narrative at every step and dismantling oppressive structures. My work is not only about writing code and building products but extends to advocating fairness, justice, and equity in all aspects of my work. As I tread this space, I cannot help but be cognizant of the power dynamics at play and the historical legacies that have shaped the present realities. I must be aware of the power dynamics that come to the fore in such spaces, and I have to be deeply conscious of historical legacies which continue to determine our present-day realities. I shall be careful, though, not to project my opinions onto others and therefore act against the grain of this emerging decoloniality principle.</p>
    <p>Inspired by 'eros' from Sareeta Amrute, I try to weave a fabric of human connection, empathy, and inclusion. I try to see the human behind every individual and not simply a resource. The road toward decoloniality is always evolving, and so are its processes. It means being in a constant state of learning, unlearning, and relearning, continuously engaging with new thoughts and ensuring that my actions are synched with the principles of decoloniality.</p>
    <p>In sum, based on a strong sense of obligation, my understanding of my place in the sector and my role in decoloniality, I commit myself to using skills and influence to challenge oppressive structures, foster inclusivity, and contribute to creating a tech industry that is truly equitable and just for all.</p>
